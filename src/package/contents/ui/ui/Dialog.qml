Imports:
        QtQuick 1.0
        org.kde.plasma.core

Description:
        Provides a top-level window for short-term tasks and brief interaction with the user.
        A dialog floats on the top layer of the application view, usually overlapping the area reserved for the application content. Normally, a dialog provides information and gives warnings to the user, or asks the user to answer a question or select an option.

Properties:
        list<Item> buttons:
        A list of items in the dialog's button area. For example, you can use Row or Button components but you can also use any number of components that are based on Item component.

        list<Item> content:
        A list of items in the dialog's content area. You can use any component that is based on Item. For example, you can use ListView, so that the user can select from a list of names.

        int status:
        Indicates the dialog's phase in its life cycle. The values are as follows:
            - DialogStatus.Opening - the dialog is opening
            - DialogStatus.Open - the dialog is open and visible to the user
            - DialogStatus.Closing - the dialog is closing
            - DialogStatus.Closed - the dialog is closed and not visible to the user
        The dialog's initial status is DialogStatus.Closed.

        list<Item> title:
        A list of items in the dialog's title area. You can use a Text component but also any number of components that are based on Item. For example, you can use Text and Image components.

        Item visualParent:
        The item that is dimmed when the dialog opens. By default the root parent object is visualParent.

Signals:
        accepted():
        This signal is emitted when the user accepts the dialog's request or the accept() method is called.
        See also rejected().

        clickedOutside(): This signal is emitted when the user taps in the area that is inside the dialog's visual parent area but outside the dialog's area. Normally the visual parent is the root object. In that case this signal is emitted if the user taps anywhere outside the dialog's area.
        See also visualParent.

        rejected():
        This signal is emitted when the user rejects the dialog's request or the reject() method is called.
        See also accepted().

Methods:
        void accept():
        Accepts the dialog's request without any user interaction. The method emits the accepted() signal and closes the dialog.
        See also reject().

        void close():
        Closes the dialog without any user interaction.

        void open():
        Shows the dialog to the user.

        void reject():
        Rejects the dialog's request without any user interaction. The method emits the rejected() signal and closes the dialog.
        See also accept().
